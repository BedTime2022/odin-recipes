 <h2>Step by step guide</h2>
    <ol>

<li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

<li>Prick potatoes all over with the tip of a knife. Coat potatoes all over with oil, and place on the prepared sheet pan.</li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven until centers of potatoes are soft when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Let cool until just warm, about 10 minutes</li>

<li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop when cool enough to handle, and set aside.</li>

<li>Slice the large center parts of jalapenos into 36 thick rings, and remove the seeds. Dice remaining parts of peppers, and additional peppers as needed to make about 1/2 cup, or more if desired.</li>

<li>Add cream cheese and diced jalapeno to a bowl. Set aside about 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese for sprinkling on top of poppers, and add remaining cheese to the bowl. Mix well and set aside.</li>

<li>Lay each potato down on its widest, flattest side on a cutting board, and cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out cooked potato into a bowl, leaving about 1/8-inch of cooked potato attached to the skin.</li>

<li>Line a sheet pan with foil and coat with oil. Transfer scooped potato skins onto the sheet and season each one with salt. Divide cheese filling between the 12 potato skins, and spread out with a spoon.</li>

<li>Top cheese filling with bacon, and then place 3 jalapeno rings on top of each skin. Scatter reserved cheese over the top. </li>

<li>Increase the oven temperature to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). </li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is bubbling, and the edges of the potatoes are crispy, 25 to 30 minutes. </li>

</ol>
